My name is Lily Dinkins and I am a senior at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
I study Environmental Science and Geography.
I took this class to learn more about information science and
to get a better general understanding of technology. 
So far I think I have a great grasp on the benefits of using an open source website like GitHub. 
I had never even heard of GitHub before this course. 
I'm excited to learn more about making your own website, as well as database design and maintence.
