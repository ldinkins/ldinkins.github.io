My name is Lily Dinkins and I am a senior at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill
I study Environmental Science and Geography.
I took this class to learn more about information science and
to get a better general understanding of technology. 
So far I think I have a great grasp on the benefits of using an open source website like GitHub. 
I had never even heard of GitHub before this course. 
I'm excited to learn more about making your own website, as well as database design and maintence.

# Commands To Remember
These are the commands I have learned as well as the ones I have trouble remembering.

{% highlight ruby %}
cd  - move into a different directory
pwd - show current directory
cd .. - moves up a directory 
touch - creates a new entry
{% endhighlight %} 

Previously I only had experience with website design using WordPress. 
WordPress is a very easy platform but doesn't allow for much customization. 
Learning how to use Jekyll sites on cloudnine and github is much more useful. 
Here is a website I designed using WordPress: [Epsilon Eta](http://epsiloneta.web.unc.edu/).
