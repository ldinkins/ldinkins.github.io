This project showed an interesting alternative to traditional presentations. Though honestly
I fail to see the benefit of using this method rather than Powerpoint or Pages. This seemed much more complicated 
with little reward. Uriel and I really completed all aspects of the project together. 
Most of the work we did was either in class together or on a Friday afternoon when we recoreded our presentation audio. 
On December 5th Uriel worked on adding a video but the video was creating glitches in our presentation so he recorded audio by himself instead. 
I changed the visual settings later as well as added speaker notes. 

We decided to work on bitcoins since it was a topic neither of us knew much about yet related strongly to the tech world. 
In our research, I gained more of an understanding of why bitcoins are useful. They create a security in your money not being dependant on banks. 
We mostly just had issues using Cloud9 on the school server. The preview of our presentaiton almost never worked when major changes were made. 
It was intersting, when working on the CSS file of our theme, for me to see how much Markdown and HTML I've learned since the class began.
