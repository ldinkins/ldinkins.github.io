I grew up in Manhattan on the upper upper west side. My mom is from Florida and my Dad is from North Carolina. 
They both graduated from UNC in 1982 and moved to the Lower East Side together a few years later. 
In 1990 they married and moved to Harlem where we have lived ever since. Below is an image of my block, Tiemann Place.

I went to the Bronx High School of Science where I ran cross country, indoor track and outdoor track.

I moved to Chapel Hill to begin university in August 2013. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to study Environmental Science.
Through the requirements for that major, I discovered how much I enjoyed using ArcGIS and so I declared a second major, Geography.

In fall of 2015 I spend the semester studying in Auckland, New Zealand. 
I lived in a flat right by the Uni in a neighborhood called Parnell with two Kiwi boys and a girl from Singapore.

In September I spent my two week spring break traveling around Australia and after my semester ended I road tripped around the South Island for a month.
New Zealand has the most beautiful hikes I've ever been on. I could easily spend a whole year backpacking every mountain in the country and never be bored by the incredible views.
One of my favorite hikes was called Roy's Peak in Wakanka. Below is a photo of me at the top of Roy's Peak.

I also love the Lord of the Rings movies and they were almsot entirely filmed in New Zealand.
I got to visit Hobbiton and Mount Doom!

While in New Zealand my friends and I created a food instagram to highlight the amazing resturants we went to. Check that out!
