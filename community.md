On Sunday October 16th I attended a 3D Design Workshop that taught [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) in Kenan Science Library Makerspace. 
Tinkercad is an online repository and design space that, similarly to Github is open source.
There are many previously created designs that you can customize or you can start from scratch using basic shapes which is what I did. 
I created a domed archway by aligning cubes with cyclinders and rectancles and then making the cyclinders and rectangles hollow. 
The instructor also showed a website called [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/) where you can download existing templates. 

**Here is the shape I made**

While I was there I learned that every student is allowed to 3D print 300g of material each month. 
Makerspace gives priority to students who either need to print for research or for a class but eventually they get to personal requests as well. 
[This is the link to order a 3D printed object.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfWHSCBVDBoW5cc4iUqbcAqyu-GCS1sGZzdG3J4QtRXMuu-g/viewform). 
I also learned more about how the actual printing works. The lab has four printers, two use potato based plastics and can only print basic shapes.
Another one of the printers uses another plastic but can create thin support material for taller objects that are then broken off when the object is done. 
Imagine a statuette of a person, its impossible for the printer to print in midair with no support so instead it puts extremely thin plastic until where an outreached hand is meant to be.
The larger objects can have different levels of fill depending on how dense and heavy you want. Usually they are filled with geometric webbing.

Overall, this tutorial was very interesting. I knew little to nothing about 3D printing before attending the workshop. 
I'd never really understood why it was useful besides for medical purposes but the amoung of customization that is possible really makes it worthwhile.
The woman leading the tutorial had a phone stand that she had made to fit exactly her cases' width. Still though, another woman there was 3d printing toy cars
and I don't really see the benefit of printing them rather than buying them except maybe to reduce waste. 
I'd like to go to another workshop that focuses more on 3D priting its self rather than the design side though to learn more.
