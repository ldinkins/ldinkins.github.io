In early Novemeber I took a tour of a solar farm in Chapel Hill. The farm is owned by [Strata Solar](http://www.stratasolar.com/) and is located on land rented from Vickers Farm. 
Strata was one of the first utility scale solar companies in North Carolina. The [Vickers Project](http://www.stratasolar.com/spotlight/vickers-2-7-mw/) generates 2.6 megawatts of energy that are fed directly into the grid 
through Duke Power. 

**Some of the 9,500 panels on site**

During the tour, two Strata team members discussed what it takes to connect to the grid and how they find land to use for their projects. 
At the current stage in the solar economy, any farm under 2.5 Mw is simply not feasible. This takes dozens of acres of land and the land should be south facing as well as relatively flat. 
Vickers was one of their earlier projects so the slope is not perfectly desirable because they hadn't realized what they needed yet. 
Strata is about to build it's first rotating solar farm, where the panels follow the sun throughout the day to generate maximum energy.
One of the issues that solar has in penetrating the market is that there is no baseload. Energy storage is the next frontier in terms of solar development. 
Right now, solar energy can only be used during the day creating a nightime lag on the grid. 
Luckily, even in the current political climate, North Carolina has relatively progressive policies for renewable energy.
The Strata workers explained to us that one of the things that keep them in business are Power Purchase Agreements. 
PPAs ensure that untilities will buy solar from a developer at a fixed rate for given period of time, usually 10-25 years. 
This makes solar investments relatively low risk and allows for rapid development. 
North Carolina just passed Colorado to become the state with the second most megawatts of solar installed in the country!
One interesting thing I learned was that once the panels are installed, obviously a huge upfront cost, the biggest cost comes from site maintanence. 
The many acres have to be mowed at least once a month. They tried to use sheep at one of their sites but all the sheep got quickly eaten by coyotes. 
I know other solar companies have managed to use sheep but perhaps they were further away from wooded areas? Strata also considered goats but apparently they jump all over the panels and create all sorts of technical issues.

On Sunday October 16th I attended a 3D Design Workshop that taught [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) in Kenan Science Library Makerspace. 
Tinkercad is an online repository and design space that, similarly to Github is open source.
There are many previously created designs that you can customize or you can start from scratch using basic shapes which is what I did. 
I created a domed archway by aligning cubes with cyclinders and rectancles and then making the cyclinders and rectangles hollow. 
The instructor also showed a website called [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/) where you can download existing templates. 

**Here is the shape I made**

While I was there I learned that every student is allowed to 3D print 300g of material each month. 
Makerspace gives priority to students who either need to print for research or for a class but eventually they get to personal requests as well. 
[This is the link to order a 3D printed object.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfWHSCBVDBoW5cc4iUqbcAqyu-GCS1sGZzdG3J4QtRXMuu-g/viewform). 
I also learned more about how the actual printing works. The lab has four printers, two use potato based plastics and can only print basic shapes.
Another one of the printers uses another plastic but can create thin support material for taller objects that are then broken off when the object is done. 
Imagine a statuette of a person, its impossible for the printer to print in midair with no support so instead it puts extremely thin plastic until where an outreached hand is meant to be.
The larger objects can have different levels of fill depending on how dense and heavy you want. Usually they are filled with geometric webbing.

Overall, this tutorial was very interesting. I knew little to nothing about 3D printing before attending the workshop. 
I'd never really understood why it was useful besides for medical purposes but the amoung of customization that is possible really makes it worthwhile.
The woman leading the tutorial had a phone stand that she had made to fit exactly her cases' width. Still though, another woman there was 3d printing toy cars
and I don't really see the benefit of printing them rather than buying them except maybe to reduce waste. 
I'd like to go to another workshop that focuses more on 3D priting its self rather than the design side though to learn more.
