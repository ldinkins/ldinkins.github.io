**Research Interests**

##### I am currently working on research project with my senior capstone class investigating the potential environmental justice issues with the proposed Coal Ash sites in North Carolina. In 2014, thousands of tons of coal ash from Duke Energy's ponds spilled into the Dan River. As a potential mitigation technique, the existing coal ash ponds could be moved to 96 proposed sites. My group and I are using ArcGIS and [EJ Screen](https://ejscreen.epa.gov/mapper/) from the EPA to determine this linkage. We are also interested in cummulative issues so we are including Toxic Release Inventory data. Besides this project, I am interested in the global water crisis especially in how it releates to public health and WASH issues.
